    <p>
      INCOLN in caricature is a phase of the career of the great war President
      that has thus far lacked adequate treatment. Yet he was the most bitterly
      assailed and savagely cartooned public man of his time, and one has only
      to search the newspapers and periodicals of that period to find striking
      confirmation of this fact. The attitude of Great Britain toward the Union
      and its President was then one of cynical and scarcely veiled hostility,
      and nowhere were the sentiments of the English government and of the
      English masses more faithfully reflected than in the cartoons which
      appeared in London <i>Punch</i> between 1861 and 1865, many of which had
      Lincoln for their central figure. He was also frequently cartooned in <i>Vanity
      Fair</i> the American counterpart of <i>Punch</i>; in <i>Frank Leslie's
      Illustrated Newspaper</i>, and in <i>Harper's Weekly</i>. Indeed, nowhere
      were the changing sentiments of the people of the North, their likes and
      dislikes, their alternates hopes and fears, their hasty, often unjust
      judgments of men and measures, more vividly reflected than in the cartoons
      dealing with Lincoln which appeared in the last named journal during the
      epoch-making days of his Presidency. Thus the thirty-two plates from these
      sources here brought together have a value and interest already important
      and sure to increase with the passage of time, for they reflect with
      unconscious vividness, and as nothing else can do, the life and color of
      an historic era, and how his fellows regarded the grandest figure of that
      era. It is with their value as human documents in mind that they have been
      rescued from their half-forgotten hiding places, and assembled in
      chronological sequence, with such comment as may be necessary to make
      their purpose and meaning clear to older men, whose memory may have grown
      dim, as well as to the new generation that has come upon the stage in the
      eight and thirty years that have elapsed since the close of the Civil War.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>late Number One&mdash;This
      cartoon, "Lincoln à la Blondin," which appeared in <i>Harper's Weekly</i>,
      on August 25, 1860, seems to have been suggested by Blondin's crossing of
      Niagara on a tight rope with a man on his back&mdash;an event then fresh
      in the public mind. It also recalls an interesting phase of Lincoln's
      first campaign for the Presidency, which had its origin in a
      characteristic incident of the candidate's earlier years. It was in March,
      1830, that Lincoln, at that time a youth of twenty-one, removed with his
      father and family from Indiana to Illinois, locating on the bluffs of the
      Sangamon River about ten miles from Decatur. There he and his kinsman,
      John Hanks, built a hewed log house, and broke fifteen acres of prairie
      sod with the two yoke of oxen they had driven from Indiana. They then
      felled the trees, cut off the logs, and with mauls and wedges split the
      rails to fence in the land they had broken. The following winter, the
      winter of the "deep snow" as it was known in Illinois, Lincoln alone made
      three thousand rails for a neighbor, walking three miles each day to do
      it. The Republican state convention of Illinois assembled at Decatur on
      May 9, 1860, and the first act of its chairman was to invite Lincoln, who
      was modestly seated in the body of the hall, to a seat upon the platform.
      An eye-witness describes the scene that followed as one of tumultuous
      enthusiasm. No way could be made through the shouting throng, and Lincoln
      was borne bodily, over their heads and shoulders, to the place of honor.
      Quiet restored, the chairman again arose and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is an old Democrat outside who has something he wishes to present
      to this convention."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the door of the hall swung open, and a sturdy old man marched in,
      shouldering two fence-rails, surmounted by a banner inscribed, in large
      letters:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two rails from a lot made by Abraham Lincoln and John Hanks in the
      Sangamon Bottom, in the year 1830."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bearer was John Hanks himself, and he had come to do his part in
      making his old friend President. "It was an historic scene and moment. In
      an instant Lincoln, the rail-splitter, was accepted as the representative
      of the working man and the type and embodiment of the American idea of
      human freedom and possible human elevation. The applause was deafening.
      But it was something more than mere applause," for there was no opposition
      afterwards, to a resolution that declared Lincoln to be the first choice
      of the Republicans of Illinois for President, and instructed the delegates
      to the national convention to cast the vote of the State as a unit for
      him. It is a part of history how the tidal wave of enthusiasm behind this
      resolution swept from Decatur to Chicago, and thence over the country.

      cartoon, "The Inside Track," published in <i>Vanity Fair</i>, on March 2,
      1861, has for its motive the popular doubt and incertitude attending the
      make-up of the Cabinet and the policy of the new Administration toward the
      South. The President-elect is shown, with a doubtful expression on his
      face, flanked on either side by Thurlow Weed, who is drawn to represent a
      western river gambler of the period, and William H. Seward, while Horace
      Greeley, their sworn political foe, thrusts his head through the door in
      time to hear Weed remark impressively: "Trust to my friend Seward&mdash;trust
      to us. We'll compromise this little difficulty for you. But trust to us.
      Gentlemen from the country are often swindled by unprincipled sharpers.
      Trust to us." Seward, as we know, became Lincoln's Secretary of State, and
      Weed one of his trusted advisers, while the editor of the <i>Tribune</i>
      remained until the end a thorn in the side of the President.

      March 9, 1861, holds up to ridicule Lincoln's memorable secret journey
      from Harrisburg to Washington, but its point-of-view is a mistaken one.
      Lincoln's advisers had good grounds for believing that there existed a
      plot to murder him during his passage through Baltimore, and every
      consideration forbade needless risk. The trip across Maryland was,
      therefore, made suddenly and in private, but there was no attempt at
      personal disguise, as the cartoon infers, nor any undignified concealment
      on the part of Lincoln or the friends who accompanied him.

      when the truth was brought home to its people that a war between the
      sections was not to be avoided. It shows the President watering a flower
      bed with the "Spirit of '76," and remarking to Columbia, who watches his
      work: "Ain't there a nice crop! There's the hardy Bunker Hill flower, the
      Seventh Regiment pink, the firebug tulip. That tri-colored flower grows
      near Independence Hall. The western blossoms and prairie flowers will soon

      "What charming plant is this?" asks Columbia, pointing to a miniature

      constable in the act of arresting Davis. "I've got you now, Jeff," are his
      words as he lays hold of his prisoner. "Guess you have," is the reply of
      Davis. "Well, now let us compromise."

      in <i>Punch</i> on January 11, 1862. The artist, whose point-of-view is

      and having in mind Davy Crockett's familiar story of Colonel Scott and the
      coon, depicts that animal with the head of Lincoln, crouched on the limb

      Sinbad carrying on his shoulders the Old Man of the Sea&mdash;Gideon
      Welles, whose course as Secretary of the Navy was then the cause of much
      ill-natured comment. We had no navy when the war began, and Welles had to
      create one. His way of doing it provoked much opposition, but he had
      always the confidence of the President, and so good a judge as the late
      Charles A. Dana has told us that though "there was no noise in the street
      when he went along, he was a wise, strong man, who understood his duty,
      and who was patient, laborious and intelligent at his task." The generous
      growth of hair which the artist has given Welles was not his own. Instead
      he wore a wig, which was parted in the middle, the hair falling down on
      each side, and it was, perhaps, from his peculiar appearance that the idea
      originated that he was old-fashioned in his methods.

      artist, borrowing from the old nursery tale, showed Lincoln seated in a
      corner and plucking a plum from the generous pudding in his lap. Possibly
      for fear that his design might not be perfectly clear to the British mind,
      the artist appended to it the legend: "Big Lincoln Horner, up in a corner,
      thinking of humble pie, found under his thumb, a New Orleans plum, and

      cartoon, "The Latest from America," published in <i>Punch</i> on July 26,
      1862, aims to make light of the war news sent out from New York at that
      time. The President is represented as a bartender, standing behind a bar
      on which are bottles inscribed "Bunkum," "Bosh" and "Brag," and shifting a
      concoction labelled "The New York Press" from the glass of Victory to that
      of Defeat.

      on September 27, 1862, has for its motive the Union's crying need of men
      and money. The President is shown seated at a desk, with hands, as usual,
      thrust into his pockets, glancing discomfitedly at a paper inscribed "I
      promise to subdue the South in ninety days&mdash;A. Lincoln," held out to
      him by a Confederate soldier, who says "Your ninety days' promissory note
      isn't taken up yet, sirree!" It would have been more fitting to have made
      Seward the central figure in this cartoon, for it was Lincoln's Secretary
      of State, and not the President himself, who was loudest in proclaiming
      that the war would end in three months. It is worth recording that Seward
      when questioned in after years by a friend as to the reasons which
      prompted this famous prediction of his, at first declined to give an
      answer, but finally said that he believed at the time that if the South
      did not give in within ninety days the North would.

      Proclamation, the President being pictured as a vagrom bird-peddler, whom
      an absence of customers impels to the remark: "Darn these here
      black-birds. If nobody won't buy'em I'll have to open the cages and let'em
      fly." This design recalls an historic Cabinet meeting held on the Saturday
      following the battle of Antietam, which cut short Lee's invasion of the
      North and compelled him to recross the Potomac. The members of the Cabinet
      were summoned, on this occasion, not to give advice but to hear a
      decision. The President told them that the hour for delay had passed, and
      that the time had come to make the emancipation of the slaves the declared
      policy of the Administration. Public sentiment would now sustain it. A
      strong and outspoken popular voice demanded it, and the demand came from
      the best friends of the government. "And I have promised my God that I
      would do it," added the President, reverently and in a low voice. "Did I
      understand you correctly, Mr. President?" asked Secretary Chase, who had
      heard but indistinctly the low-voiced utterance. "I made a solemn vow,
      before God," was the answer, "that if General Lee should be driven back
      from Pennsylvania, I would crown the result by the declaration of freedom
      to the slaves." And he did.

      Seventeen&mdash;This cartoon, without title, published in <i>Harper's
      Weekly</i>, on January 3, 1863, was prompted by the fearful Union
      slaughter at Fredericksburg. Columbia confronts the President and demands
      an accounting for the thousands slain in that conflict. "This reminds me
      of a little joke," Lincoln is made to say. "Go," is the angry rejoinder,
      "tell your joke at Springfield." Which calls to mind a story told the
      writer by the late Governor Curtin of Pennsylvania. It was after the
      battle of Fredericksburg, and Governor Curtin had gone to the front to
      look after his State's dead and wounded in person. While thus engaged he
      received a telegram from Lincoln bidding him come to Washington. He
      responded at once, and reaching the White House late in the evening found
      that the President had retired. Seated by the latter's bedside, he told
      what he had seen. "It was not a battle," said he; "it was, a slaughter.
      Many of the wounded have received no attention, and thousands of the dead
      are still unburied. From the bottom of my heart, Mr. President, I wish we
      could find some way of ending this war."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln listened patiently, but with manifest anxiety, to the Governor's
      statement. When it was finished, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curtin, it's a big job we've got on hand. It reminds me of what once
      happened to the son of a friend of mine out in Illinois. There was an
      apple-tree in the old man's orchard of which he was especially choice, and
      one day in the fall his two boys, John and Jim, went out to gather the
      apples from this tree. John climbed the tree to shake the fruit off, while
      Jim remained below to gather it as it fell. There was a boar grubbing in
      the orchard, and seeing what was going on, it waddled up to the tree and
      began to eat the falling apples faster than Jim could gather them from the
      ground. This roiled Jim, and catching the boar by the tail he pulled
      vigorously, whereat the latter, with an angry squeal, began to snap at his
      legs. Afraid to let go, Jim held on for dear life, until finally, growing
      weary, he called to his brother to help him. John, from the top of the
      tree, asked what was wanted.'I want you,' said Jim, between the rushes of
      the boar,'to come down here and help me to let go of this darned hog's
      tail.' And Curtin," added the President, "that's just what I want of you
      and the rest: I want you to pitch in and help me let go of the hog's tail
      I have got hold of."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before beginning this story Lincoln had been deeply depressed. When it was
      finished he laughed as heartily as did his auditor, and seemed instantly
      to recover his wonted spirits. "Pardon me, Mr. President," said the
      Governor, prompted by this change of mood, "but is not this story-telling
      habit of yours a sort of safety valve for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have hit it, Curtin," was the quick reply. "If I could not tell these
      stories I think I should die."

      American President and the Russian Czar are depicted triumphantly clasping
      hands in the foreground of an impressive picture of rapine and desolation.
      The result sought by the artist is made clear in the appended dialogue:

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Polish insurrection, then in progress, furnishes the motive of this
      cartoon, which serves to recall the good will shown by Russia for the
      Union, when it stood without other friends among the nations. How
      substantial was this good will furnishes the cue to a chapter in our
      history which yet remains to be written. A part of this chapter the writer
      once had from the lips of the late Simon Cameron, of Pennsylvania. Just
      before General Cameron went to Russia as American Minister in the early
      part of 1862 he was charged with a secret commission. He was directed,
      upon the presentation of his letters to the Russian Chancellor in St.
      Petersburg, to say that President Lincoln asked that the Minister might
      have a personal and confidential interview with the Czar. If this was
      accorded he should say to the Czar that the President was troubled about
      the possibility of interference by England or France in behalf of the
      Confederacy, and that if the friendship of Russia was such as to justify
      the monarch in conveying, confidentially, any intimation of his feelings
      and attitude in such a contingency, the President would be grateful. The
      interview was accorded, the message was delivered and the answer was
      cordial, and in about these words: "The friendship of Russia for the
      United States has long continued, and is such as to justify the
      President's request. The reply of Russia is ready. You will convey to Mr.
      Lincoln my personal regards, and say that the danger of interference by
      any European nation is exceedingly remote; but in that improbable
      contingency, or upon the appearance of real danger of it, the friendship
      of Russia for the United States will be made known in a decisive manner,
      which no other nation will be able to mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      This message was duly reported to the President. How the Czar kept his
      promise came out in an interview which he granted in 1879 to Wharton
      Barker, for many years Russian financial agent in America. He said to
      Barker: "In the autumn of 1862 France and England proposed to Russia in
      formal (but not in official) way, the joint recognition by European
      nations of the independence of the Confederate States. My immediate answer
      was:'I will not cooperate in such action, and I will not acquiesce; but,
      on the contrary, I shall accept recognition of the independence of the
      Confederate States as a <i>casus belli</i> for Russia, and that the
      governments of France and England may understand that this is no idle
      threat, I will send a Pacific fleet to San Francisco and an Atlantic fleet
      to New York.' Sealed orders were given to both admirals. My fleets arrived
      at the American ports, there was no recognition of the independence of the
      Confederate States by England and France, the American rebellion was put
      down and the great American republic continues. All this I did because of
      love for my own dear Russia. I acted thus because I understood that Russia
      would have a more serious task to perform if the American republic, with
      advanced industrial development, was broken up and England left in control
      of most branches of modern industrial development."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was England's warm resentment of Russia's attitude that prompted the
      cartoon under consideration. Even more pronounced in its mocking cynicism
      was <i>Punch's</i> cartoon for November 7, 1863. The tacit alliance
      between Russia and the United States still grated upon English
      sensibilities, and the artist provoked the multitude to laughter by
      depicting the President as Mephistopheles saluting the Russian bear. Hard
      things in plenty were said of Lincoln, both at home and abroad, but this
      is the only instance in which he was portrayed in Satan's livery. British
      malice could go no further than this.

      Twenty-six&mdash;This cartoon, "This Reminds Me of a Little Joke,"
      published in <i>Harper's Weekly</i>, on September 17, 1864, recalls the
      extraordinary Presidential campaign of that year. There was, during the
      opening months of 1864, a determined and more or less noisy opposition to
      the renomination of Lincoln. This came from two sources&mdash;the radical
      abolitionists, who chafed at what they called the President's half-hearted
      policy in regard to slavery, and another element, which, while supporting
      the Union, believed that slavery should be let alone; but it shrank into
      insignificance as time went on, and when the Republican Convention met at
      Baltimore on June 7, Lincoln was renominated on the first ballot. The
      Democratic National Convention was held twelve weeks later in Chicago. A
      few days before it met President Lincoln said to a friend: "They must
      nominate a peace Democrat on a war platform, or a war Democrat on a peace
      platform." The convention chose the second of these alternatives. It
      adopted a platform which declared the war a failure and demanded an
      immediate cessation of hostilities, and it nominated for President the
      best known of all the war Democrats, General George B. McClellan. The
      latter's chances of election, whatever they may have been, disappeared
      within a fortnight of his nomination. The course of the war during the
      summer had been studded thickly with bloody and seemingly indecisive
      battles. Both in the East and the West the opposing armies were grinding
      in almost continuous struggle. But Sherman's capture of Atlanta and
      Farra-gut's entrance into Mobile harbor, proved to the people of the North
      that the end was in sight, and when the President called for five hundred
      thousand more men they came forward rapidly, a large and valuable
      percentage of them being volunteers who had served their time under
      previous enlistments. Long before election day it was evident that no
      prospect remained of Democratic success. When the polls were closed and
      the votes counted, Lincoln's enormous popular majority of more than
      400,000 fairly buried the McClellan electoral tickets. Kentucky and
      Delaware, with New Jersey, testified their disgust with Emancipation, but
      they were of small account in an electoral college of 233 votes, wherein
      212 were solidly against them.

      Get Out of It," was published in <i>Punch</i> on November 5, 1864. It has,
      in the light of after events, a touch of humor not intended by the artist.
      When it was drawn, the belief was generally prevalent in England that
      Lincoln's defeat at the coming election was a foregone conclusion. Thus,
      this cartoon pictures Lincoln and Davis bound to adjacent benches by
      ropes, significantly labelled "Debts," but it was still wet from the press
      when Lincoln, as we have just seen, was re-elected by the largest majority
      in the electoral college ever given to a candidate.

      published in <i>Harper's Weekly</i>, on November 26, 1864, tells its own
      story and bears witness to the joyful relief with which the people of the
      North greeted the re-election of Lincoln. Very like the foregoing in
      spirit and treatment (and for that reason not reproduced in this place) is
      a cartoon published in <i>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</i> on
      December 3, 1864. It bears title, "Jeff Davis' November Nightmare," and
      places the President, with legs drawn up, on the bed of the Confederate
      leader. "Is that you still there, Long Abe?" asks the suddenly awakened
      man. "Yes, and I am going to be four years longer," is the reply.

      on December 3, 1864. Its character is explained in its title, and it shows
      one of those fabled birds, on which the artist has placed the head of
      Lincoln, rising from a pyre, the fuel for which is furnished by commerce,
      credit, the Constitution, a free press, habeas corpus and State rights.
      How it impressed the public for whom it was intended can only be
      conjectured, but to the eyes of an American, a generation after the death
      of the man whom it thus held up to condemnation, it seems as brutal in
      motive as it is misleading in fact.

      represents Lincoln remonstrating with the American eagle in the dress of
      Uncle Sam over the Senate's proposed abrogation of Canadian treaties.
      "Now, Uncle Sam," the President is reported as saying, "you're in a darned
      hurry to serve this notice on John Bull. Now, it's my duty as your
      attorney, to tell you that you may drive him to go over to that cuss,
      Davis." But John Bull was not to be driven "over to that cuss, Davis." Two
      months later the war was ended, and Lincoln dead. <i>Punch</i> has
      caricatured him for the last time.

      published in <i>Harper's Weekly</i>, on April 15, 1865. Lincoln, who had
      lately made his last visit to the front, was represented, with a drumhead
      for a table, writing from City Point, Virginia: "All seems well with us."
      These words, in the light of after events, are not without a touch of
      pathos. When the journal in which they appeared reached its readers,
      Booth's bullet had done its work and Lincoln had become the gentlest

      Thirty-two&mdash;This cartoon, "Britannia Sympathizes with Columbia,"
      published in <i>Punch</i>, on May 6,1865, testifies to the world-wide
      grief which attended the death of the great war President, and shows how
      strong had become his hold upon all men who love brave deeds and honest
      lives. Britons had not hesitated to criticise and upbraid him living, but
      dead they were quick to recognize him as the noblest, knightliest figure
      of an age rich above all things else in the number and grandeur of its
      great men.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been impossible to trace the authorship of most of the cartoons
      herewith reproduced from <i>Harper s Weekly</i> and <i>Frank Leslie's
      Illustrated Newspaper</i>, but three of them, at least, are known to be
      from the pencil of the elder Frank Bellew, an English artist who came to
      this country to embark with John Brougham in the publication of a
      short-lived weekly, called the <i>Lantern</i>, later helping to found half
      a dozen other periodicals. Bellew had cleverness and versatility, and a
      rich vein of humor, as the drawings "Sinbad Lincoln and the Old Man of the
      Sea," "Lincoln's Last Warning" and "Long Abraham a Little Longer" bear
      witness, but he failed to achieve complete success in his work, and left
      no impress upon the political thought of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The designer of a majority of the cartoons reproduced from <i>Vanity Fair</i>,
      which, between 1859 and 1863, ran a checkered but lively existence, was
      the late Henry Louis Stephens, a man of fertile and incisive wit, with
      unusual ability to enforce a pictorial moral by simple yet telling
      methods. For a brief period Mr. Stephens's attitude toward Lincoln seems
      to have been touched by the not always good-natured suspicion with which
      the public regards a new and comparatively untried man; but no sooner had
      Sumter been fired upon than the artist and his journal became ardent and
      unswerving in their support of the Union, and so continued until the end.
      Stephens's drawings, though somewhat crude and faulty in method, are,
      nevertheless, notable for their originality and force. He lacked, however,
      either the inclination or the opportunity to continue in the field for
      which he had shown so marked an aptitude, and long before his death, in
      1883, fallen into obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the cartoons reproduced from London <i>Punch</i> are from the
      pencil of Sir John Tenniel, who, in 1901, concluded half a century of
      brilliant service on that journal. Tenniel was already an artist of repute
      when he joined the staff of <i>Punch</i> in 1851, and for many years
      preceding his self-sought retirement he was recognized as incomparably the
      greatest caricaturist of his time&mdash;his pencil a force to be taken
      into account by sagacious statesmen in every forecast of the drift of
      public opinion. His range is not a wide one, yet within its clearly
      defined limits he is nearly always powerful. Although his methods are
      usually simple, through them he secures signal breadth and strength, while
      now and then he gives an impression of power such as one fancies an Angelo
      might have given had he amused himself by drawings reflecting upon the
      politics of his time. If there was any doubt in official minds respecting
      the necessity of sending an army to the rescue of Khartoum, it vanished
      when Tenniel drew his picture of General Gordon standing behind an
      earthwork and looking across the desert for a glimpse of the expected
      redcoats. That touched the heart of England, and was more potent than the
      fiercest denunciation from the Opposition bench of the Gladstone
      ministry's inaction in the Soudan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tenniel is first of all a satirist, but he has seldom been either unjust
      or unfair in his work. His longest and most memorable departure from
      fairness was when, in common with the ruling class of England generally,
      he misinterpreted our Civil War and caricatured the chief actor therein
      with astonishing perversity. Still, he was not more frequently or more
      deeply in the wrong than some of our own politicians, who could not plead
      his excuse of distance from the scene, and, to his credit, be it said,
      when once convinced of his error he made prompt and generous amends
      therefor. Nothing could have been more fitting nor finer in its way than
      his design, already referred to, which showed Britannia laying a wreath on
      the bier of the martyred President and which was accompanied by these
      appreciative lines from the pen of Tom Taylor:

    </p>
    <p>
      Between the mourners at his head and feet,

      Say, scurril jester, is there room for <i>you?</i>

      This rail-splitter, a true-born king of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      My shallow judgment I have learned to rue,
    </p>
    <p>
      Noting how to occasion's height he rose;
    </p>
    <p>
      How his quaint wit made home-truth seem more true,
    </p>
    <p>
      How, iron-like, his temper grew by blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      How humble yet how hopeful he could be;
    </p>
    <p>
      How in good fortune and in ill the same;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor bitter in success nor boastful he,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirsty for gold, nor feverish for fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He went about his work, such work as few
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever had laid on head and heart and hand,
    </p>
    <p>
      As one who knows where there's a task to do,
    </p>
    <p>
      Man's honest will must Heaven's good grace command;
    </p>
    <p>
      Who trusts the strength will with the burden grow,
    </p>
    <p>
      That God makes instruments to work His will,
    </p>
    <p>
      If but that will we can arrive to know,
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor tamper with the weights of good and ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went forth to battle on the side
    </p>
    <p>
      That he felt clear was Liberty's and Right's,
    </p>
    <p>
      As in his peasant boyhood he had plied
    </p>
    <p>
      His warfare with rude Nature's thwarting mights;
    </p>
    <p>
      The uncleared forest, the unbroken soil,
    </p>
    <p>
      The iron-bark that turns the lumberer's ax,
    </p>
    <p>
      The rapid that o'erbears the boatman's toil,
    </p>
    <p>
      The prairie, hiding the mazed wanderer's tracks,
    </p>
    <p>
      The ambushed Indian and the prowling bear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the deeds that helped his youth to train:
    </p>
    <p>
      Rough culture, but such trees large fruit may bear,
    </p>
    <p>
      If but their stocks be of right girth and grain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So he grew up, a destined work to do,
    </p>
    <p>
      And lived to do it; four long-suffering years'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ill-fate, ill-feeling, ill-report, lived through,
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he heard the hisses changed to cheers,
    </p>
    <p>
      The taunts to tribute, the abuse to praise,
    </p>
    <p>
      And took both with the same unwavering mood;
    </p>
    <p>
      Till, as he came on light, from darkling days,
    </p>
    <p>
      And seemed to touch the goal from where he stood,
    </p>
    <p>
      A felon hand, between the goal and him,
    </p>
    <p>
      Reached from behind his back, a trigger prest,
    </p>
    <p>
      And those perplexed and patient eyes were dim,
    </p>
    <p>
      Those gaunt, long-laboring limbs were laid to rest!
    </p>
    <p>
      The words of mercy were upon his lips,
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgiveness in his heart and on his pen,
    </p>
    <p>
      When his vile murderer brought swift eclipse
    </p>
    <p>
      To thoughts of peace on earth, good will to men.

    <p>
      Sore heart, so stopped when it at last beat high,
    </p>
    <p>
      Sad life, cut short, just as its triumph came.

      If more of honor or disgrace they bore;

    <p>
      But thy foul crime, like Cain's, stands darkly out.

      With much to praise, little to be forgiven.

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
